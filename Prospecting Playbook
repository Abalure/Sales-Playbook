# Prospecting Playbook

Objective
This playbook helps you find, research, and reach out to the right prospects—setting a strong foundation for the sales process and helping you build a pipeline that’s worth your time.

1. Target Identification
    Define Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): Who’s most likely to need and benefit from what you’re selling? Focus on specifics like industry, company size, revenue range, and the decision-maker’s role. This can save tons of time and ensure you’re targeting the right people.
    Get into the Buyer’s Shoes: Develop a simple "buyer persona" to better understand the goals, challenges, and pain points of the people you’ll be speaking with. Ask yourself questions like: What’s their role in the decision-making process? What keeps them up at night?
2. Research Methods
    Social Media Platforms: LinkedIn and Twitter can be gold mines. Check the company’s recent posts or activities and see if there’s something timely you can mention. For individuals, look for shared interests or connections.
    Company Websites & News: A quick look at the company’s website and recent news will often reveal major wins, new product launches, or even challenges. Referencing something specific in your outreach shows you’re not just copy-pasting emails!
3. Outreach Strategy
    Personalization is Key: No one likes a generic email! Referencing specific details from your research—like a recent award or news article—can make your outreach stand out.
    Simple, Effective Email Template  that can look like 
    Subject: Quick Idea for [Prospect's Company]

    Hi [Prospect's Name],

    I saw [a recent accomplishment or relevant info about their company]. I thought it might be helpful to share a quick idea on how we’ve helped similar companies tackle [specific problem]. Could we set up a 10-minute call to see if it’s relevant for you?

    Looking forward,  
    [Your Name]

4.  Multi-Channel Outreach
    Email First: Start with a short, personalized email. This shows respect for their time and gives them a chance to read through at their own pace.
    Follow Up with a Call: If there’s no reply in 1–2 days, call them to see if they received your message. A direct follow-up can make all the difference.
    LinkedIn Connection: Send a connection request or message that highlights the value you offer. Avoid anything overly salesy—focus on how you can help.

5. Qualification Frameworks
    BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing): It’s worth using a framework like BANT to gauge whether a prospect’s in the right stage for a conversation. Check if they have the budget, authority, a specific need, and the timing aligns.
    CHAMP (Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization): This framework can also be helpful to guide your conversation around identifying challenges they’re actively trying to solve.
